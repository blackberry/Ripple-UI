Notwithstanding Section 2, You acknowledge and agree that You will not be permitted to access certain APIs in the SDK for all or certain purposes unless the code for Your Application has been electronically signed by RIM.  You further acknowledge and agree that RIM may, but has no obligation, to require You to submit certain information respecting Your identity, Your Application, and Your having obtained certain third party licenses, as a condition of RIM signing the code for Your Application.  Furthermore, RIM reserves the right to refuse to sign the code for Your Application, or to revoke any and all code signing already granted for Your Application including, without limitation, if, at any time:  (a) RIM deems, in its sole and reasonable discretion, that Your Application does not require access to the APIs for which code signing is requested in order to be used in conjunction with the BlackBerry Solution or Handheld Products as the case may be, (b) RIM has a reasonable apprehension that Your Application may interfere with, degrade, or otherwise adversely affect the BlackBerry Solution, Handheld Products, and/or any other software, system, network or data, (c) RIM has a reasonable apprehension that the information that You have provided to RIM in order to obtain access to such APIs is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, (d) RIM is prohibited from signing the code for Your Application due to governmental, contractual or other restrictions of applicable authority, such as a court of competent jurisdiction, (e) You have breached, or RIM has a reasonable apprehension of Your imminent breach, of this Agreement or any other agreement between You and RIM, (f) RIM learns that You do not have a license required under certain third party intellectual property rights in place, or (g) Your Application accesses or is designed to access the TTS Functionality.
<br>
<br>4.  Certification.  You acknowledge and agree that You are solely responsible for obtaining any certification of Your Applications required by an Airtime Service Provider respecting Your Application's compatibility and safe operation with the wireless network of such Airtime Service Provider.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, You further agree that RIM shall have no liability whatsoever to any third party for any claim or action relating to any of Your Applications, and that even if RIM signs the code for Your Application, such signing shall not in any event constitute an endorsement, certification, representation, guarantee, covenant or warranty with respect to Your Application or Your Application's compatibility with the BlackBerry Solution or any part thereof, or with any other product, software or service, including without limitation the wireless network of any Airtime Service Provider, and You shall not represent it as such to any other person.
<br>
<br>5.  SDK Updates.  RIM is under no obligation to provide You with any Updates.  However, if RIM does provide You with any Updates, such Updates shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the License) or such agreement, if any, which accompanies such Updates, including a possible requirement to make payments to RIM in respect thereof.  Further, to enable all or part of the functionality of an Application you may need to enter into one or more additional agreements with RIM.
<br>
<br>6.  Limitation of License Grant.  This Agreement does not give You a license or any entitlement to any portion of the BlackBerry Solution or to any airtime services.  If You require the BlackBerry Solution or any portion thereof and/or airtime services from an Airtime Service Provider, You are solely responsible for arranging at Your own expense the necessary licenses and agreements.
