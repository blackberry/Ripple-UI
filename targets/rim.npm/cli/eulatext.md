You are hereby relieved of Your obligation under the BlackBerry App World Vendor Agreement to pay any portion of Your Application Revenue to RIM in respect of the sales of In-App Products made using the BlackBerry Payment Service. 

### 5. In-App Product Acceptance.  
When You submit Your Application through the Vendor Portal for acceptance in BlackBerry App World, You must also provide a description of the products, services and content that You wish to make available to End Users through that Application using the BlackBerry Payment Service.  You must provide all information about these potential In-App Products reasonably requested by RIM and any applicable MoR, through the Vendor Portal or otherwise, including without limitation any Vendor Content, and upon request a sample or samples of the products, content or service that You wish to have considered for acceptance as an In-App Product.  Once a product, service or content is accepted as an In-App Product You will be notified of same, and once the Application through which it is to be made available is accepted and downloaded from BlackBerry App World to an End User;s device, the End User will be able to use the BlackBerry Payment Service to purchase copies of that In-App Product using the BlackBerry Payment Service.  In addition to the warranties set out in this Agreement, You hereby warrant, represent and covenant that any product, service or content You wish to submit for consideration as an In-App Product will comply with the then current version of the BlackBerry In-App Product Guidelines. 

### 6. End User Agreement. 
You shall include an End User agreement enforceable in the jurisdiction(s) in which the In-App Products are to be made available, under which You intend to license or sell the In-App Products, within the In-App Products, or within the Application through which the In-App Products are made available (in either case, the "In-App Product Agreement").  You must include in the In-App Product Agreement the same exclusions of liability and third party beneficiary requirements required to be in the Application EULA under the terms of the BlackBerry App World Vendor Agreement.  You acknowledge and agree that neither RIM nor any MoR shall be under any obligation to enforce in any manner the provisions of the In-App Product Agreement, or any other agreement between You and the End User.  Any provision of the In-App Product Agreement that is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement shall have no force or effect in respect of In-App Products made available through the BlackBerry Payment Service.     

### 7. Access to BlackBerry Payment Service.  
RIM and/or an MoR may, at any time, in their sole discretion and for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation a breach of the BlackBerry In-App Product Guidelines, excessive returns or chargebacks associated with an In-App Product, a payment processor;s refusal to provide services in relation to an In-App Product,  Your failure to meet Your fulfillment and/or support obligations set out in this Schedule, or a third party claim made in relation to an In-App Product, with or without advance notice to You, cease to make the BlackBerry Payment Services available in relation to an Application or a particular In-App Product, at all, or in part, including only in specified jurisdictions, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute RIM;s or any MoR;s commitment to make available , or to continue to make available, the BlackBerry Payment Services in respect of Your In-App Products, or at all.   If RIM does not provide You with notice of the removal prior to it taking place, RIM shall do so, by means of the Vendor Portal or otherwise, within a commercially reasonable period following the removal.  You further acknowledge that RIM has the right, but has no obligation, to remove an In-App Product from an End User wireless handheld device and/or disable (in whole or in part) the operation of an In-App Product, if the End User;s payment for that In-App Product has been refunded by, or charged back to the applicable MoR, or if the End User has engaged in fraud, or as provided in the BlackBerry In-App Product Guidelines (including without limitation a breach thereof).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, You further acknowledge and agree that RIM may, at any time, in RIM;s sole discretion and for any reason whatsoever, remove an In-App Product from an End User;s wireless handheld device.

### 8. Ongoing Availability of In-App Products/Support of In-App Products.  
You must continue to make In-App Products available to the End User through the Application with which they were associated on BlackBerry App World for no less than six (6) months after the date of the download of the copy of the Application through which they are made available and in no event less than the period they are required to be available to the End User by the laws in the jurisdiction of the End User.  You are solely responsible for, and You agree to provide, End Users with support in making In-App Products they have purchased available to them (including providing End Users with a support contact email address), and with reasonable technical and product support to End Users with respect to the In-App Product features, installation and use, which shall include at minimum any warranty for In-App Products consistent with the laws in the jurisdiction of the End User.  

### 9. Fulfillment/Re-fulfillment Obligations.  
In-App Products are not fulfilled (i.e. not hosted, delivered or enabled) through BlackBerry App World.  Further, neither RIM nor any MoR fulfills any In-App Products, and You are solely responsible for fulfillment of In-App Products, and must satisfy Your fulfillment obligations in respect of each In-App Product.  You therefore will be required to act as the fulfillment agent for the applicable MoR for Your In-App Products.  If You require additional information about this obligation, You should contact appworldvendorsupport@rim.com.  Neither RIM nor any MoR associates In-App Products with Applications in My World or otherwise tracks or displays In-App Products in My World.  Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by RIM, for any In-App Product that is intended to be used as part of or in conjunction with the Application through which it was purchased (e.g. a level of a game), You must re-associate (i.e. re-fulfill) the In-App Product with the Application through which it was purchased, upon reinstallation of that Application from My World either: (a) automatically; or (b) upon request by the End User.  In the case of Consumable In-App Products, You are only required to re-associate the portion of In-App Products that have not been consumed at the time of reinstallation.  Neither RIM nor any MoR is responsible for keeping track of consumption of Consumable In-App Products.  If You require additional information about these obligations, You should contact appworldvendorsupport@rim.com.  

### 10. License Restrictions.  
The Carrier Networks and/or countries You select for an Application;s availability will automatically apply to any In-App Products made available through that Application.   You acknowledge and agree that In-App Products may be downloaded by End Users with wireless handhelds operating on Carrier Networks and that Carrier Networks includes not only the wireless networks selected by You, but also wireless networks operated by the roaming partners of those carriers (and further includes any wireless networks in the case of RIM proprietary wireless handhelds that are distributed by RIM without the capability of operating on a wireless cellular network).  Subject to the foregoing, If You do not have the rights necessary to distribute an In-App Product (or any portion thereof) either globally, or at least to End Users with wireless handhelds activated on both the wireless networks You specify in the Vendor Portal for the Application and on the associated roaming wireless networks, and to permit others to do so, or if You are otherwise unable to control the jurisdictions in which End User may download and/or use that In-App Product, then You must not make, or seek to make, that In-App Product available through the BlackBerry Payment Service.      

### 11. Returns of In-App Products.  
You acknowledge and agree that the applicable MoR is responsible for and shall have sole discretion in setting and applying the returns policy for instances of In-App Products sold by that MoR.

### 12. Reporting.  
RIM will, from time to time, provide You with aggregated data on sales of In-App Products using the BlackBerry Payment Service.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent RIM from obtaining and publicly disclosing aggregate data relating to the sales of In-App Products using the BlackBerry Payment Service. 

### 13. Privacy.  
The Consent to Collection of Information provisions in this Agreement shall apply equally to End User Data and personally identifiable information made available in the context of the BlackBerry Payment Service.  The enumerated purposes for which such information may be used as set out in the Consent to Collection of Information provision is hereby extended to include any purpose related to the provision or Your use of the BlackBerry Payment Service.  Similarly, the Privacy and Data Protection provision in the BlackBerry App World Vendor Agreement applies to Your In-App Products and Your use of the BlackBerry Payment SDK and the references in the Privacy and Data Protection provision to the BlackBerry App World Guidelines shall be deemed to be references to the BlackBerry In-App Product Guidelines.    

### 14. Confidentiality.  
There is no need for You to provide to RIM any confidential information in relation to the BlackBerry Payment Service, and You acknowledge and agree that RIM has no confidentiality obligation with respect to any information provided by You to RIM under or in relation to Your In-App Products, the BlackBerry Payment Service or the BlackBerry Payment Service SDK.   

### 15. Independent Development.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, You acknowledge and agree that RIM is also a  developer and licensee of digital products, services and content that operate on RIM and RIM affiliates; proprietary software platforms, and that RIM may currently or in the future develop, use, market, promote, distribute and/or license products and/or services and/or content that are similar to and/or competitive with any In-App Products, and that no provision of this Agreement prohibits or limits in any manner RIM;s ability to do so.

### 16. BlackBerry Payment Service Availability.  
You acknowledge and agree that RIM is under no obligation to continue to make available the BlackBerry Payment Service or to make available any subsequent versions of the BlackBerry Payment Service SDK.  You further acknowledge and agree that RIM may add or remove functionality with respect to the foregoing and may cease to make available the foregoing at any time without any obligation or liability to You.  You shall be solely responsible for any modifications that may be required to Your Applications as a result of any modifications to or subsequent versions of the BlackBerry Payment Service and/or Payment Service SDK (including without limitation the addition or removal of functionality with respect to the foregoing).

### 17. Distributable Code.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, You may not modify all or any portion of the Payment Service SDK, including without limitation Distributable Code that forms part of the Payment Service SDK.

### 18. Additional Payment Service SDK License Restrictions 
(a) You shall not use the BlackBerry Payment Service for making available, and shall not provide as part of an In-App Product, software updates, upgrades, or modifications to the associated Application or any executable file formats.  However, You may enable (i.e. unlock) functionality that already exists within an Application through an In-App Product (e.g. unlock a level within a game).  Updates and upgrades for Your Applications are treated as new versions of Your Applications and must be submitted through the App World submission process described in the BlackBerry App World Vendor Agreement and cannot be made available as In-App Products. 
With respect to the BlackBerry Payment Service payment processes You shall only rely on the user interface functionality provided by means of RIM APIs, and shall not use, invoke, or present to any End User, any other user interface functionality.

### 19. Termination.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement You shall immediately prevent any further purchases of In-App Products through   Applications using the BlackBerry Payment Service. 

### 20. Conflict.  
In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Schedule 3 and the remainder of this Agreement the provisions of this Schedule 3 shall govern to the extent of such conflict.
