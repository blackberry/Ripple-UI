## Build Requirements

* nodejs, npm
* OSX or linux (windows is not currently supported for development)

## Getting Started

If you plan to dive into the source, be sure to check out the [HACKING](https://github.com/blackberry/Ripple-UI/blob/master/HACKING.md) file.

To get started, you need to setup a few things, first- run (in the project root):

    ./configure

This script will pull down the needed npm packages and initialize the submodules.

## Build Commands

    jake

This will build ripple to the `pkg/` folder. In that folder there are various targets that can be used.

    jake -T

This will describe all the available commands for building and running the tests, etc.

## Running As A Chrome Extension

* Go to the extension management page (chrome://chrome/extensions/) in chrome.
* Ensure that you have selected the developer mode checkbox.
* Click the Load Unpacked extension button.
* Select the `pkg/chrome.extension` folder.

NOTE: For development you should be fine to just build with jake and refresh your browser.
If you end up editing anything in the ext folder you will need to refresh the extension from the extension management page.

For more information see [doc/chrome_extension.md](https://github.com/blackberry/Ripple-UI/blob/master/doc/chrome_extension.md).

## Running Inside Other Web Browsers

Ripple is (by-design) browser agnostic, and is able to run inside any web browser (with disabled web security).

However, this has (for the most part) only been used in Chrome (and as a result certain things are used that are not supported/tested in other browsers).

If you want to run it inside other browsers, you will need to use the `pkg/web` target. This is essentially a standalone version of the UI.

**Note: This is not actively maintained, and may not work as expected.**

To get it running inside Chrome you should start it with these [command line](http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags) flags:

    --app=http://path/to/ripple-ui/pkg/web
    --disable-web-security
    --user-data-dir=/path/to/dummy/profile

## CLI & NPM Package

There is a command line interface that can be paired with the client (UI).

It can be used for various things, such as statically hosting an application, and running a local (cross origin) XHR proxy.

Eventually, this will be available on the NPM registry. For now (to install):

    git clone git@github.com:blackberry/Ripple-UI.git ripple
    cd ripple
    ./configure
    jake
    npm install -g pkg/npm

This will install a global script called `ripple`. To see usage, run:

    ripple help

Note: If you don't want to use NPM, you can just do this:

    node pkg/npm/bin/ripple help
